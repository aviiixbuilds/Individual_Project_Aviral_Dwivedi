This project is a simple and visually appealing product landing page for the SNKRD brand. It has been created using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or external frameworks. The design follows a futuristic and neon theme, giving it a modern, high-tech look inspired by sneaker culture and cyber aesthetics.
The page includes a navigation bar, a main hero section featuring a floating sneaker image, a product details section highlighting features, and a recommended products area displaying different sneaker variants. A smooth ticker effect has also been added at the top of the page to display moving promotional offers, making the site more engaging and lively. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that it adjusts well across both desktop and mobile devices.
All the sneaker images used in this project are AI-generated and stored in the local “images” folder. Each image is displayed using relative file paths, which ensures they work correctly when the project is hosted online, including on GitHub Pages. The styling mainly focuses on glassmorphism, glowing neon edges, and soft animations to create depth and a premium futuristic experience.
To run the project, simply open the “index.html” file in any web browser or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code. The folder structure includes “index.html”, “style.css”, and an “images” folder containing all the sneaker visuals. You can easily customize the colors, background, animations, or text by editing the CSS file according to your preference.
This project was made as a creative experiment to practice modern CSS styling and animation techniques, and to design an eye-catching sneaker website using only basic web technologies.
